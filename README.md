A web application to archive books into a book database using browser's local storage
<br>
Users are expected to provide Book name, author name and ISBN numbers to archieve books to the browsers local storage. So that even if the browser s refreshed the books will be available.
<br>
If needed, the books can be deleted from the local storage.
<br>
Any time a book is added, deleted, or failed to add/remove there will be message shown at the top of the document with a signaling color.

<br> 
in the document appes6.js, it can be found the ES6 syntax for the complete application. However in the version app.js, there is only ES5 syntax which lacks of the local storage integration.
